# CV Project: VAE residual Analysis

## Questions that we want to tackle: 
1. We want to see to what extent does residual between reconstruction and ground truth contains sufficient information to reconstruct the original image?
2. Can we train an encoder to reconstruct just base on the residual?
3. Are there any signficant meanings that are represented in the residual?
